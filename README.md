Drools is a business-rule management system with a forward-chaining and 
backward-chaining inference-based rules engine, allowing fast and reliable
evaluation of business rules and complex event processing. A rules engine is
also a fundamental building block to create an expert system which, in artificial 
intelligence, is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability 
of a human expert.
